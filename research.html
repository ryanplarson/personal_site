<h2>NORC Felony Disenfranchisement Survey Experiment</h2>
<p>Alongisde collaborators Dr. Chris Uggen (University of Minnesota),
Dr. Andrew Lindner (Skidmore College), and Iris Fuglie (Hamline
University undergraduate), I fielded an original survey experiment
through NORC’s AmeriSpeak panel to investigate the correlates of
attitudes about felony disenfranchisement among Americans. Specifically,
we experimentally manipulated exposure to different messages surrounding
felony disenfranchisement policy (race, partisan, democracy) and are
examining the treatment effects on punitive policy support and how these
may be moderated by other punitive and race-based attitudes.</p>

<h2>The Patterns, Causes, and Consequences of Cash Bail in
Minnesota</h2>
<p>Alongside Dr. Josh Page and the Minnesota Justice Research Center, we
are engaging in research that will help answer the question: “What are
the social patterns of cash bail and pretrial justice in Minnesota, and
what are the downstream consequences of these criminal legal
practices?”</p>
<p>We propose to: AIM 1. Descriptively examine the landscape of pretrial
justice and cash bail in Minnesota. AIM 2. Examine the social and
spatial causes and consequences of cash bail in Minnesota. AIM 3.
Examine the causal effect of cash bail on downstream criminal legal and
socioeconomic outcomes.</p>
<p>Methodologically, this project involves 1) descriptive analysis of
the social and spatial patterns of cash bail and pretrial justice, 2)
panel models investigating the social causes and consequences of cash
bail at the Tract-year level, and 3) judge severity IV design
identifying the causal effects of cash bail at the individual-level on
downstream criminal legal and social outcomes.</p>

<h2>Hennepin County Search Warrant Project (HCSWP)</h2>
<p>Our pilot phase of the Hennepin County Search Warrant Project
(HCSWP?) has consisted of a quantitative content analysis of Hennepin
County Minnesota search warrants from the first three quarters of 2019.
Our focal research questions are the following: - What is the “hit rate”
(i.e., the probability of an anticipated, listed item being found in a
search) of items in search warrants? - How frequently are confidential
informants used in the search warrant process? - What impact do
confidential informants have on the “hit rate” of items found? - Does
the impact of confidential informants on the “hit rate” vary by item or
case characteristics?</p>
<p>With potential funding, we hope to expand our analytical sample to
other Minnesota counties and other years to extend the external validity
(i.e., generalizability) of our pilot study.</p>

<div id="the-iatrogenic-effects-of-punishment" class="section level2">
<h2>The Iatrogenic Effects of Punishment</h2>
<p>My dissertation examines the link between punishment and crime at
three different levels of analysis, specifically investigating how
punishment can exacerbate crime and criminogenic contexts, both directly
and indirectly through its impact on existing stratification and
collateral consequences. The quantitative analyses examine how
punishment’s varied forms, intensities, and contexts are implicated in
the (re)production of class and racial inequalities, the structuring of
American neighborhoods and contexts, and the corrosion of general social
health; all of which are implicated the genesis of crime.</p>
<p><em>The Causal Packaging Effects of Punishment</em></p>
<p>The United States has experienced a marked rise across multiple forms
of punishment, such as incarceration, probation, and monetary sanctions
during the era of mass incarceration. However, studies examining the
impacts of punishment on recidivism have a) primarily focused solely on
the effects of incarceration and b) treated each axis of punishment as a
separate, isolated factor, in contrast to how they are experienced as a
“package” of punishment. This study leverages a natural experiment using
the quasi-random assignment of judges within Minnesota Judicial
Districts and estimates the causal impacts of incarceration, probation,
and monetary sanctions on recidivism, while also examining how each
punishment mode may condition the impact of the other. Findings indicate
that the relationship between punishment and subsequent crime is weak
overall, but the packaging of probation and LFOs together may be
criminogenic. Further, negative effects for incarceration are only
present amongst more advantaged defendants. These findings suggest that
the impacts of punishment should be studied as they are experienced – as
a mutually-constitutive package of confinement, surveillance, and
financial costs.</p>

</center>
<p><em>Punishment, Concentrated Disadvantage, and Crime</em></p>
<p>A long tradition of sociological and criminological research has
documented the ecological effects of neighborhoods on crime rates.
Theories and research on neighborhood ecology highlight the causal
importance of neighborhood structure for crime, and, in particular,
concentrated disadvantage. However, this literature largely neglects
what role punishment, in terms of incarceration, probation, and monetary
sanctions, plays in this theoretical model. Building upon previous
scholarship that suggests that punishment plays a key role in the
(re)production of social inequality and disadvantage, this chapter uses
a unique panel dataset – merging hospital discharge, state court
punishment records, socioeconomic and demographic Census data – to
examine how neighborhood punishment loads may a) directly impact rates
of violent injury, and b) impact violence indirectly through the
patterning of concentrated disadvantage. Results from ZCTA (Zip Code
Tabulation Area)-year fixed effect panel models highlight that while
incarceration has a direct negative effect on violence, and probation a
positive association, both incarceration and probation are positively
associated with concentrated disadvantage, which is, in turn, positively
associated with disadvantage. These results reveal the bifurcating
effects of punishment on violence at the community level, and highlights
a criminogenic path of punishment on violence via the augmentation of
disadvantage.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/diss2.png" style="width:70.0%" />
</center>
<p><em>Ban-the-Box, Employment, and Crime</em></p>
<p>This empirical chapter investigates a state policy with the potential
to mitigate some of the iatrogenic effects of punishment on crime via
employment: ban-the-box (BTB) legislation. While previous research has
investigated the effects of these policies for individual employment,
questions remain as to whether these laws impact macro-level employment
and, distally, crime rates. This chapter leverages a uniquely
constructed panel dataset of U.S. states from 1995-2020 and estimates
staggered adoption difference-in-difference (DID) models to estimate the
causal effect of BTB legislation on both employment and crime at the
state-level. I estimate an average treatment effect of -1.7 for
nonemployment, marking BTB laws as catalysts for state-level employment,
but that these effects are moderated by both race and a state’s history
of criminal record production. The results on crime are much weaker,
suggesting that BTB legislation does not reach to significantly reduce
state-level crime.</p>

<h2>Multistate Study of Monetary Sanctions</h2>
<p>Minnesota is one of eight states included in the <a

Sanctions</a>, led by principal investigator <a
href="https://soc.washington.edu/people/alexes-harris">Alexes Harris</a>
(University of Washington), investigating systems of monetary sanctions
in the United States. Using automated court data provided by the
Minnesota State Court Administrator’s Office, alongside interviews and
ethnographic observations, I am collaboratively examining the role of
race in the sentencing of LFOs, as well as the role of LFO
concentrations on neighborhood poverty and housing instability. I have
been investigating the extra-legal effects of race on incarceration,
probation, and monetary sanctions (under review at <em>American
Sociological Review</em>), as well as the impact of LFO amounts on
recidivism, legal cynicism, system avoidance, and other aspects of
social life.</p>

both Minnesota and Washington. Further, I and the Minnesota team are

<h2>Complex Relationships between Punishment, Policing, and Health</h2>
<p>As part of a interdisciplinary collaborative team (including Jeanie
Santaularia, Christopher Robertson, and Christopher Uggen), I have been
investigating the relationships between punishment, policing, and
health, using novel quantitative data including hospital discharge
records. The first paper, published in <em>Violent Epidemiology</em>,
examines the relationships between county-level criminal punishment and
violence. A second paper examines the temporal and spatial patterns in
gun assault hospital discharges before and after the police killing of
George Floyd using an interrupted time-series design ( <em>Spatial and
Spatiotemporal Epidemiology</em>). We also have an analysis documenting
the racially heterogeneous effects of the police murder of Mr. Floyd in
Minneapolis (<em>American Journal of Epidemiology</em>), as well as some
preliminary work examining the voting patterns surrounding Amendment 2
in Minneapolis.</p>

<p><em>Structural Racism, Police Shootings, and Health</em></p>
<p>I have submitted a grant application as a MPI, alongside Dr. Jeanie
Santaularia a collaborator of mine who is an epidemiologist at the
University of Washington. We have applied for a $250,000 grant from the
Fund for a Safer Future Advisory Group in their call for, “What work to
prevent firearm-related death, injury, harm, trauma, and to promote
healing.” Our proposed study is titled “The Causes and Consequences of
Police Shootings”, and the goal of our mixed-method project is to
advance knowledge on the complex interplay of historical/contemporary
racism, police shootings, and health. We propose to:</p>
<p>AIM 1. Examine the impact of historical redlining and racial
covenants2 on police shootings. AIM 2. Examine the impact of police
shootings on health. AIM 3. Examine to what extent which police
shootings mediate the relationship between historical redlining and
racial covenants and health. AIM 4. Understand how police shootings
affect health outcomes, and how strategies of resilience used by
community members may shape these processes.</p>
<p>Briefly, one arm of our study intends to quantify the impact of
spatial exposure to historical structural racism (redlining, racial
covenants) on contemporary rates of police shootings at the census-tract
level. We then assess the extent to which police shootings moderate the
relationship between historical racial exclusion and various health
outcomes (e.g., mental health, preterm birth, community firearm
injuries, etc.). We hypothesize that police firearm violence is one
amongst a broader suite of mechanisms that tie historical legacies of
structural racism to contemporary health disparities. We also have a
qualitative arm to this study, wherein we plan to conduct
semi-structured interviews with Minneapolis and St. Paul residents who
have been exposed to a police shooting, and investigate the experiences
and strategies of resilience amongst those who encounter police firearm
violence. Our theoretical model is as follows:</p>
