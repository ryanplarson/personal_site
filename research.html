<div id="the-iatrogenic-effects-of-punishment" class="section level2">
<h2>The Iatrogenic Effects of Punishment</h2>
<p>My dissertation examines the link between punishment and crime at
three different levels of analysis, specifically investigating how
punishment can exacerbate crime and criminogenic contexts, both directly
and indirectly through its impact on existing stratification and
collateral consequences. The quantitative analyses examine how
punishment’s varied forms, intensities, and contexts are implicated in
the (re)production of class and racial inequalities, the structuring of
American neighborhoods and contexts, and the corrosion of general social
health; all of which are implicated the genesis of crime.</p>
<p><em>The Causal Packaging Effects of Punishment</em></p>
<p>The United States has experienced a marked rise across multiple forms
of punishment, such as incarceration, probation, and monetary sanctions
during the era of mass incarceration. However, studies examining the
impacts of punishment on recidivism have a) primarily focused solely on
the effects of incarceration and b) treated each axis of punishment as a
separate, isolated factor, in contrast to how they are experienced as a
“package” of punishment. This study leverages a natural experiment using
the quasi-random assignment of judges within Minnesota Judicial
Districts and estimates the causal impacts of incarceration, probation,
and monetary sanctions on recidivism, while also examining how each
punishment mode may condition the impact of the other. Findings indicate
that the relationship between punishment and subsequent crime is weak
overall, but the packaging of probation and LFOs together may be
criminogenic. Further, negative effects for incarceration are only
present amongst more advantaged defendants. These findings suggest that
the impacts of punishment should be studied as they are experienced – as
a mutually-constitutive package of confinement, surveillance, and
financial costs.</p>

<p><em>Punishment, Concentrated Disadvantage, and Crime</em></p>
<p>A long tradition of sociological and criminological research has
documented the ecological effects of neighborhoods on crime rates.
Theories and research on neighborhood ecology highlight the causal
importance of neighborhood structure for crime, and, in particular,
concentrated disadvantage. However, this literature largely neglects
what role punishment, in terms of incarceration, probation, and monetary
sanctions, plays in this theoretical model. Building upon previous
scholarship that suggests that punishment plays a key role in the
(re)production of social inequality and disadvantage, this chapter uses
a unique panel dataset – merging hospital discharge, state court
punishment records, socioeconomic and demographic Census data – to
examine how neighborhood punishment loads may a) directly impact rates
of violent injury, and b) impact violence indirectly through the
patterning of concentrated disadvantage. Results from ZCTA (Zip Code
Tabulation Area)-year fixed effect panel models highlight that while
incarceration has a direct negative effect on violence, and probation a
positive association, both incarceration and probation are positively
associated with concentrated disadvantage, which is, in turn, positively
associated with disadvantage. These results reveal the bifurcating
effects of punishment on violence at the community level, and highlights
a criminogenic path of punishment on violence via the augmentation of
disadvantage.</p>
<p><em>Ban-the-Box, Employment, and Crime</em></p>
<p>This empirical chapter investigates a state policy with the potential
to mitigate some of the iatrogenic effects of punishment on crime via
employment: ban-the-box (BTB) legislation. While previous research has
investigated the effects of these policies for individual employment,
questions remain as to whether these laws impact macro-level employment
and, distally, crime rates. This chapter leverages a uniquely
constructed panel dataset of U.S. states from 1995-2020 and estimates
staggered adoption difference-in-difference (DID) models to estimate the
causal effect of BTB legislation on both employment and crime at the
state-level. I estimate an average treatment effect of -1.7 for
nonemployment, marking BTB laws as catalysts for state-level employment,
but that these effects are moderated by both race and a state’s history
of criminal record production. The results on crime are much weaker,
suggesting that BTB legislation does not reach to significantly reduce
state-level crime.</p>

<h2>Multistate Study of Monetary Sanctions</h2>
<p>Minnesota is one of eight states included in the <a
href="http://www.monetarysanctions.org/">Multi-State Study of Monetary
Sanctions</a>, led by principal investigator Alexes Harris (University
of Washington), investigating systems of monetary sanctions in the
United States. Using automated court data provided by the Minnesota
State Court Administrator’s Office, alongside interviews and
ethnographic observations, I am collaboratively examining the role of
race in the sentencing of LFOs, as well as the role of LFO
concentrations on neighborhood poverty and housing instability. I am
also examining the extra-legal effects of race on incarceration,
probation, and monetary sanctions (under review at <em>American
Sociological Review</em>) as well as the impact of LFO amounts on
recidivism and other aspects of social life.</p>

<div id="punishment-and-violence" class="section level2">
<h2>Punishment and Violence</h2>
<p>Collaborative work has estimated the relationships between
county-level punishment and violent victimization as measured by
hospital records. The first paper, published in <em>Violent
Epidemiology</em>, examines the relationships between county-level
criminal punishment and violence. A second paper examines the temporal
and spatial patterns in gun assault hospital discharges before and after
the police killing of George Floyd using an interrupted time-series
design. We are also working on examining the mental health aftereffects
of police violence, as well as document the voting patterns surrounding
Amendment 2 in Minneapolis. I am also currently collaborating with
scholars in the School of Public Health at the University of Minnesota
exploring the spatial concentrations of carjackings in Minneapolis, and
which carjacking events local media is responsive to.</p>

<h2>Dual Debtors Project</h2>
<p>The Dual Debtors Project is mixed-method collaborative research that
examines the nexus of criminal justice debt and child support debt. I am
a Co-Investigator on a grant from the <em>Linda and John Arnold
Foundation</em> where we investigate the relationships between criminal
justice and child support debt. My current work investigates whether
child support arrears are responsive to criminal justice debt, and
whether these institutional forms of debt interact to pattern crime.</p>

<h2>Felony Disenfranchisement Estimates</h2>
<p>Collaboratively with Chris Uggen, Sarah Shannon, and Robert Stewart,
we have compiled estimates of the population disenfranchised due to a
felony record. We estimated that 6.1 million were legally
disenfranchised due to a felony criminal record as of election day 2016,
5.2 million on election day 2020, and 4.6 million as of the midterm 2022
elections. Our estimates are published by <a
